# Changelog

## 1.8.1

### Added
- Adds `filter/find-form-usage`: finds every post/page embedding a given Gravity Form — the GF block, the `[gravityform]` shortcode, and any block (including ACF) holding the form id in a form-shaped attribute key. Detection is name-agnostic so it works across sites, tunable via the `filter_abilities_form_reference_keys` filter, and returns the block ref/path so results chain into `mutate-block` for repointing.

## 1.8.0

### Added
- Expands Gravity Forms support from listing/entries into full form, field, confirmation, notification, and add-on feed management.
- Adds `filter/validate-conditional-logic` so agents can lint Gravity Forms conditional logic before writing it.
- Adds Mailchimp picker abilities for audiences, tags, merge fields, and groups.
- Adds a drop-in functional test runner for the new form abilities.

### Changed
- Improves feed field mapping, duplicate-label entry output, form capability checks, and error reporting for invalid Gravity Forms writes.
- Hardens local media tests so `.test` fixture downloads and Filter AI upload side effects do not mask Filter Abilities results.

## 1.7.0

### Added
- **Block Editing module** (`filter-blocks`) — surgical, block-aware Gutenberg editing over MCP. Wraps the vendored GravityKit Block API engine so AI agents can read a parsed block tree with stable refs and submit targeted changes to a single block (instead of regenerating an entire `post_content` string, which routinely drops `<!-- wp:... -->` delimiters and corrupts the post). Abilities: `filter/get-post-blocks`, `filter/list-block-types`, `filter/update-block`, `filter/insert-blocks`, `filter/delete-blocks`, `filter/mutate-block`, `filter/batch-edit-blocks`. See `docs/BLOCK-EDITING.md`.

## 1.6.0

### Added
- **`filter/upload-media`** — sideload up to 50 remote URLs into the media library in one call (matches `filter/list-media`'s per-page cap; raise via the `filter_abilities_upload_media_max_batch` filter). Supports per-item `title`, `alt_text`, `caption`, `description`, `post_parent`, `date`, `set_as_featured_image`, and an `original_id` echo field for ID-mapping during cross-site migrations. Calls `set_time_limit(0)` and raises the image memory limit so large batches have a chance to complete. SSRF-guarded against loopback, link-local, and RFC1918 sources.
- **`filter/rewrite-content`** — new Migration Tools module. Rewrites media references in post content, Gutenberg block attributes (`core/image`, `core/gallery`, `core/cover`, `core/media-text`, `core/video`, `core/audio`, `core/file`), `wp-image-{ID}` classes, `[gallery]` shortcodes, featured-image postmeta, and ACF image/gallery/file fields, using a caller-supplied `media_map`. Defaults to `dry_run: true`; provide `dry_run: false` to apply.
- `filter/list-media` output extended with `caption`, `description`, `post_parent`, and `size_urls` (a `{size_name: url}` map covering all intermediate sizes, including `full`). The `size_urls` values are the input expected by `filter/rewrite-content`'s `media_map[].old_size_urls`.
- `filter_abilities_is_safe_external_url` filter — lets advanced users whitelist specific internal hostnames for `filter/upload-media`. Use sparingly.
- `filter_abilities_rewrite_block_attrs` filter — lets consumers register handlers for custom block types in `filter/rewrite-content`.
- `tests/test-media-abilities.php` — drop-in functional test runner covering all of the above (extended `list-media`, `upload-media` happy-path / batch / SSRF / batch cap / featured-image, `rewrite-content` dry-run / applied / mutual-exclusion validation).
- `docs/MIGRATION.md` — end-to-end cross-site migration guide covering the full media + post + reference-rewrite workflow, with worked examples, recovery patterns, recipes, and extension-point documentation.

## 1.5.1

### Fixed
- Plugin author metadata: now reads "Filter" linking to https://filter.agency.

## 1.5.0

### Added
- Anonymous opt-in telemetry via the StellarWP Telemetry library, sending only WordPress version, PHP version, locale, multisite flag, and active Filter plugins to https://telemetry.filter.agency.

## 1.4.3

### Changed
- Replaced StellarWP's default `Debug_Data` provider (≈60KB per ping with full plugin/theme/server config) with a minimal Filter-specific provider (≈500 bytes). Now sends only: WP version, PHP version, locale, multisite flag, site URL, and a map of active Filter plugin slugs → versions.

## 1.4.2

### Fixed
- StellarWP telemetry opt-in modal not appearing. The library exposes a `stellarwp/telemetry/optin` action but doesn't decide where to fire it; we now hook `admin_notices` to trigger the modal on admin pages for users with `manage_options`.

## 1.4.1

### Fixed
- Fatal `TypeError` on plugins_loaded when initialising telemetry: di52's `Container` does not formally implement StellarWP's `ContainerInterface`. Added a small adapter so the container satisfies the contract.

## 1.4.0

### Added
- **Anonymous opt-in telemetry** via the StellarWP Telemetry library. Sends WordPress version, PHP version, locale, multisite status, plugin version, and which Filter plugins are active to `https://telemetry.filter.agency`. Disabled by default — admins are prompted via the StellarWP opt-in modal on first activation.
- Server URL can be overridden via the `FILTER_ABILITIES_TELEMETRY_URL` constant in `wp-config.php` for local testing.

### Changed
- StellarWP Telemetry, lucatume/di52, and stellarwp/container-contract dependencies are bundled under the `Filter\Vendor\` namespace via Strauss to prevent collisions with other Filter plugins on the same site.

## 1.3.3

### Added
- `author` parameter on `filter/create-post` and `filter/update-post` — pass a user ID to set or reassign post authorship. Requires `edit_others_posts` capability.

## 1.3.2

### Added
- `date` parameter on `filter/update-post` — set post date in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.

## 1.3.1

### Added
- **Content Management** — 3 new abilities:
  - `filter/get-post-by-url` — Look up a post by URL path or slug, returns full post data
  - `filter/delete-post` — Trash or permanently delete a post
  - `filter/bulk-post-actions` — Bulk publish, draft, trash, restore, or permanently delete multiple posts

## 1.3.0

### Added
- **Redirection Management module** — 8 new abilities for managing the [Redirection](https://redirection.me/) plugin:
  - `filter/list-redirects` — List redirect rules with filtering by status, group, and search term
  - `filter/list-redirect-groups` — List redirect groups with redirect counts
  - `filter/list-404-errors` — View 404 errors with optional URL grouping to identify most-hit missing pages
  - `filter/get-redirect-logs` — View redirect hit logs to verify redirects and see traffic patterns
  - `filter/redirect-stats` — Aggregate stats overview including top 404 URLs and most-used redirects
  - `filter/check-redirect` — Check if a URL path has a matching redirect rule (supports exact and regex matching)
  - `filter/manage-redirect` — Create, update, or delete a redirect rule
  - `filter/bulk-manage-redirects` — Enable, disable, delete, or reset hit counters for multiple redirects at once
